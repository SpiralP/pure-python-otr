Python OTR
==========
This is a pure Python OTR implementation; it does not bind to libotr.

Included in this package is a Gajim Python plugin to enable OTR support
in the Gajim XMPP/Jabber client. This plugin is called gotr.

Install the potr Python module:

    sudo python setup.py install

To use the Gajim plugin please see the gotr README file.

__Dependencies__: pycrypto >= 2.1 (see dlitz/pycrypto)


libotr SWIG bindings
====================
python-otr.pentabarf.de and pyotr.pentabarf.de redirect here.
If you are still looking for the old C library bindings, they have moved
to <http://python-otr-old.pentabarf.de/>
