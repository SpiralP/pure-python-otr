This is a pure Python OTR implementation; it does not bind to libotr.

Included in this package is a Gajim Python plugin to enable OTR support
in the Gajim XMPP/Jabber client. This plugin is called gotr.

Install the potr Python module:

  sudo python setup.py install

To use the Gajim plugin please see the gotr README file.
